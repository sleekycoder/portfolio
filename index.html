        <div class="About Me">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a 19-year old Male software developer. I am mainly interested in <span>building software and breaking hardware</span> trying to figure out how they work. My interest in software engineering stems from a foundational problem-solving "talent". I have deep admiration for the thought process that goes into building any new software, starting from the top-most desired goal and then breaking into smaller parts and then focusing on making each "small" part work and bringing them up together; that's what gets my blood racing personally.</p>

            <p>I am currently in my second year of study at The University of Nairobi studying Computer Science</p>
